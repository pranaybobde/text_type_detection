# text_type_detection
Here, It is a simple and easy to understand project of text classification model i.e whether the text is in active voice or passive voice.
As we are dealing with text data and machine can not understand text, so we first convert that text into numerical data and then fit that into the logistic regression model.
Note: Dataset I have used is very limited and small and hence model may face overfitting issue. But if you want to avoid this problem then use large and relevent dataset to train model.
